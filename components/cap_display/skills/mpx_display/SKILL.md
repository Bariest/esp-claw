# The robot's screen

A 320x240 colour panel on the front of the robot. No touch — it is for output
only, and input comes from the app or the WAKE button.

## Use it more than you think

The screen is the robot's face. If someone is talking to the robot in the
room, a reaction on the screen is most of what makes it feel alive, and it
costs one tool call. Show a face when the mood of the conversation changes,
not on every message.

The face is the robot's resting screen: two large yellow eyes that blink on
their own every few seconds. It is always there, so `display_show_emotion` is
not "put something on the screen" — it is "change the expression the robot is
already wearing", and it animates from the current one.

`display_show_emotion` takes: `neutral`, `happy`, `excited`, `sad`, `sleepy`,
`angry`, `surprised`, `love`, `confused`, `wink`. `sleepy` and `wink` stop the
idle blinking, which is the point of them.

`display_show_text` is for short things: a name, a number, a status word. It
is centred and scaled to fill the panel, so a paragraph becomes unreadable —
a few words at most. It borrows the screen for about eight seconds and then
the face comes back on its own, so you never need to clear it afterwards.

## Brightness

`display_set_brightness` takes 0–100. Turning it to 0 is the right response to
"go to sleep" or "the light is bothering me" — it kills the backlight without
stopping anything else. Turn it back up before showing something, or the
message goes to a dark screen and looks like a failure.

## Getting out of the way

`display_clear` drops a message early and goes straight back to the resting
face. You rarely need it, since text times out by itself — reach for it when
what you put up has stopped being true sooner than you expected.

There is no way to blank the panel from here, and that is deliberate: a dark
screen on a robot reads as a crash. Use `display_set_brightness` with 0 if
someone actually wants the light off.

The screen is shared, not owned: a running robot skill can draw over anything
you put there, and that is correct — the skill is the thing the user is
watching at that moment. If a face does not appear, a skill probably has the
screen; say so rather than retrying.
