 * Phase 4 of docs/voice-plan.md: esp-sr's acoustic front end (AEC + VAD +
 * WakeNet) over the microphone, and the hands-free conversation loop built
 * on it.
 *
 * Two things are wired to the wake word ("Hi ESP"):
 *
 *   Barge-in. Hearing it while the robot is mid-reply sends
 *   {"type":"abort","reason":"wake_word_detected"} and stops local playback
 *   immediately. Available in both modes below.
 *
 *   Hands-free (mpx_voice_wake_auto_start(), `wake auto on`, and the boot
 *   default under CONFIG_MP4_VOICE_AUTO_LISTEN). Hearing it from idle hands
 *   the microphone to mpx_voice_talk_start_auto(): beep, stream until the
 *   server's VAD says you are done, play the reply, and go back to
 *   listening -- listening resumes while the reply is still playing, so
 *   the wake word interrupts it and starts the next turn. The socket is
 *   opened, or reopened after the server's idle timeout, on demand.
 *
 * The microphone handoff that made this "deliberately not wired" in the
 * first cut is done the simple way: mpx_audio's capture is still a single
 * stream with no owner tracking, so the hands-free task is the only thing
 * that ever moves it -- it stops the wake front end, waits for that to
 * confirm, starts the talk, waits for the talk to confirm, and starts the
 * front end again. `wake` and `voice talk` still refuse to start over each
 * other, which is what keeps a manual command from breaking the loop.
 *
 * Playback runs at 16 kHz (MPX_VOICE_PLAYBACK_RATE), not the 24 kHz the
 * server encodes at, because the speaker and the microphone share one I2S
 * peripheral and it will not run the two directions at different rates --
 * and barge-in needs the microphone open during the reply.
 *
 * Still unverified on real hardware, and worth reading before trusting
 * barge-in's AEC quality: which raw capture channel actually carries the
 * amplifier's echo-reference feedback. `wake levels` reports both channels'
 * RMS so that can be checked directly -- see its usage text.
