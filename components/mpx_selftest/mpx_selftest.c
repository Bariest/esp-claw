 * `selftest` -- does the software agree with the hardware?
 *
 * Every pin in boards/mp4_esp32_core/ was read off a schematic and has never
 * carried a signal. This command is how you find out which of those readings
 * were right, in one pass, on a bench, before anything depends on them.
 *
 * ── It does not move the servos ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That is the point of running it first. MP4_ROBOT_SERVO_BOARD_VARIANT decides
 * which physical joint a logical servo id drives, nothing validates it, and a
 * wrong variant drives the wrong joint -- which on an assembled robot means
 * legs folding the wrong way against their stops. So the servo check only
 * PINGS: it proves the SPI bus, the four chip selects and the driver boards
 * are wired as declared, and moves nothing.
 *
 * Run it with the servo rail unpowered. Everything here works without it.
 *
 * ── Reading the result ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   PASS   the hardware answered as the board files say it should
 *   FAIL   it answered, but not with what was expected -- a wiring or config
 *          mismatch, and the line says which
 *   SKIP   could not be tested here (a subsystem is off, or needs your eyes)
 *   LOOK   nothing is wrong; the panel is showing you something to judge
 *
 * A FAIL is a fact. A SKIP is not a pass -- it means this command could not
 * answer the question and something else has to.
