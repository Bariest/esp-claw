 * Phase 3 of docs/voice-plan.md: the MCP bridge.
 *
 * Phase 2 proved the socket. This turns it into the transport for a second
 * MCP server -- our own `esp_mcp_t` engine, independent of ESP-Claw's own
 * cap_mcp_server (which is hardcoded to HTTP and has never been started in
 * this firmware) -- so that JSON-RPC tool calls arriving as
 * {"type":"mcp","payload":{...}} over the xiaozhi socket reach the same
 * claw_cap_call() interface the reference plan pointed at, and results go
 * back the same way.
 *
 * What is exposed: every capability the ESP-Claw agent itself can call --
 * the same list, descriptions and schemas claw_cap gives the on-device LLM
 * (Lua, files, scheduler, skills, system, web search, HTTP, the robot, the
 * display). tools/list and tools/call are answered straight from claw_cap;
 * the esp_mcp engine only handles the session-level methods. See the note at
 * the top of the tools section in mpx_mcp_ws.c for why it is done that way.
 *
 * The cloud model therefore has exactly the reach the local agent has,
 * including write_file, lua_run_script and restart_device. That is the
 * point -- but it is worth knowing.
