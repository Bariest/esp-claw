 * Phase 2's missing half. `voice loopback` proved the codec by buffering a
 * whole clip locally; this streams frames over the real socket instead --
 * mic -> Opus -> binary WebSocket frame outbound, binary frame -> Opus ->
 * speaker inbound.
 *
 * Two ways in. `voice talk` is push-to-talk: the mic is opened, closed
 * again before any reply audio exists, and "listen" is manual-mode -- the
 * server does not run ASR until it sees {"type":"listen","state":"stop"}.
 * mpx_voice_talk_start_auto(), which mpx_voice_wake calls after the wake
 * word, is listen-mode "auto" instead: the server's VAD decides when you
 * have finished, and the first sign it has taken its turn ("stt", or "tts"
 * start) is what closes the microphone here. Either way capture and
 * playback never overlap on THIS component's account -- the reply plays
 * after the mic is closed. What may hold the mic open during a reply is
 * mpx_voice_wake's echo-cancelled front end, listening for barge-in.
 *
 * TX runs inline on its own task -- reading, encoding and sending share one
 * loop, since each blocking capture read already paces it at ~60ms/frame.
 * RX is two stages: the WebSocket event handler (mpx_voice_ws.c) just
 * copies each binary frame into this component's queue and returns
 * immediately, and a separate task here decodes and plays it. That split
 * exists because opus decode, like opus encode, wants real stack -- doing
 * it inline in the WebSocket client's own event task is how the Opus
 * loopback crash happened earlier in this project, on a task nowhere near
 * this hungry.
