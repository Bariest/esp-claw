 * This file currently covers the codec half only. The gate for it is
 * `voice loopback`: capture from the microphone, encode to Opus, decode
 * straight back, and play. If that sounds like you, the codec, the frame
 * sizes and the buffer handling are all correct -- and none of it depends on
 * a server existing, which is the point of doing it first.
